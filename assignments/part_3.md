## Automating Buienradar Data Collection on GCP (10a)

I'm basing this solution on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) due to my familiarity with it.

**1. Data Storage: BigQuery**

My reasoning for choosing BigQuery is its scalability, ability to handle large datasets (important for potential future growth), cost-effectiveness for analytical queries, and seamless integration with other GCP services.  BigQuery also enforces schema which adds to data integrity.  A schema will be defined to ensure data consistency and optimize queries. Example schema:


If the data volume grows significantly, partitioning and clustering on the `timestamp` column will be considered for enhanced query performance. This migration from the local sqlite database used in Part 1 offers a more robust and scalable solution.


**2. Data Collection: Cloud Function**

A Cloud Function, triggered by Cloud Scheduler, will handle data collection. This approach replaces the manual process from Part 1.

* **Deployment:** Deployed using a tagged version of the GitHub repository/branch. This is preferred over pointing directly to a branch, as it ensures future code stability even if the codebase is updated.
* **Dependencies:** Managed via a `requirements.txt` file.
* **Service Account:** Uses a service account with the "BigQuery Data Editor" role to grant the required permissions for writing to BigQuery.
* **Error Handling:** Logs errors to Cloud Logging and implements retries for API call failures. This adds resilience to the data collection process.


**3. Scheduling: Cloud Scheduler**

Cloud Scheduler will trigger the Cloud Function every 20 minutes using the CRON expression `*/20 * * * *`.  This automates the data collection process that was performed manually in Part 1.

**4. Security:**

* API keys (if required in the future) will be stored securely in Secret Manager. This is crucial for protecting sensitive information.
* The service account will follow the least privilege principle, having only the necessary permissions to access required resources.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Create BigQuery Table:** Define the schema in BigQuery. The path to this BigQuery table will be provided to the DatabaseManager (adapting from the local SQLite setup in Part 1).
2. **Develop Cloud Function:** Write the Python code to:
    * Retrieve data from the Buienradar API (as in Part 1).
    * Insert data into the BigQuery table.
    * Implement error handling and retries.
3. **Deploy Cloud Function:** Deploy the function using the tagged GitHub repository version.
4. **Configure Cloud Scheduler:** Create a Cloud Scheduler job to trigger the Cloud Function with the specified CRON expression.
5. **Security Hardening:** Store API keys in Secret Manager and configure the service account with minimal necessary permissions.

This solution leverages GCP's managed services to create a robust, automated, secure, and scalable data collection pipeline, significantly improving upon the manual, local setup of Part 1.
